title: "Solar Lamps: A Polish Problem on Linear Transformation"
---

I solved this problem on POI a while back, and I felt the ideas used in this problem are quite versatile. I was so intrigued by this problem that I decided to write a short summary of my intuitions and motivations in the solving process. A little bit of knowledge on linear transformations and matrices will be necassary.

If you want to try out your idea, here's the problem <a href="https://szkopul.edu.pl/problemset/problem/2yK6zUTXvAjhxSDfbjE4Zx7k/site/?key=statement">link</a>. If statement is too big for you, here's an abridged problem statement:

You are given given $n$ points where the $i$ th point is $(x_i, y_i)$. You can also given four integers $X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2$. For each point $(x_i, y_i)$ consider the angle formed by rays $(x_i, y_i)$ to $(x_i + X_1, y_i + Y_2)$ and $(x_i, y_i)$ to $(x_i + X_2, y_i + Y_2)$. $i$ th point is manually turned-on on $i$ th minute, and if a point is turned on, it illuminates the area between its angle. Additionally, if the $i$ th point is illuminated by at least $k_i$ other points, it automatically turns on and starts illuminating light. Determine for each point the first time they will start producing light.
