I"ò<p>Many problems require us to deal to dense graphs. Iâ€™ll discuss a general technique on how to solve such problems in sub-quadratic time. While this isnâ€™t anything mind-boggling, I find this technique to be extremely useful and surprisingly less-known among competitive programmers.</p>

<p>For whose who donâ€™t know what dense graphs are, they are essentially graphs with $O(n^2)$ edges. The opposite of dense graphs are called sparse graphs, which usually contain $\approx O(n)$ edges.</p>
