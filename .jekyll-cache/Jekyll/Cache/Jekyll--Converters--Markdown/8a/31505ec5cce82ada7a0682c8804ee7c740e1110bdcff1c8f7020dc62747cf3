I"®<p>Many problems require us to deal to dense graphs. Iâ€™ll discuss a general technique on how to solve such problems in sub-quadratic time. While this isnâ€™t anything mind-boggling, I find this technique to be extremely useful and surprisingly less-known among competitive programmers.</p>

<p>For whose who donâ€™t know what dense graphs are, they are essentially graphs with $O(n^2)$ edges. The opposite of dense graphs are called sparse graphs, which usually contain $\approx O(n)$ edges. Now, you might be wondering how is it possible to deal with dense graphs in sub-quadratic time while there are already quadratic number of edges. The catch is this technique is only applicable in problems where the edges are not explicitely given, rather we can decide about the edges based on some given condition. Take this for example:</p>

<hr />
<p>There are $n$ points in Cartesian plane and an integer $d$. The $i$ th point has coordinates $(x_i, y_i)$. There is a edge between point $i$ and point $j$, iff [\mid x_i - x_j \mid + \mid y_i - y_j \mid \leq d]Find out how many connected components are there in this graph.</p>

<hr />
<p>As you can see, this will be a extremely dense graph ($n \choose 2$ edges in the worse case). However, the edges are not explicitely given, but we can find out the edges based on the given condition. For this, it is an ideal problem to apply our technique. If everything weâ€™ve discussed is satisfied, we can run any algorithm in sub-quadratic time that uses only <strong>DFS/BFS</strong>. This includes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Finding the number of connected components</li>
  <li>Bicoloring the graph</li>
  <li>Strongly connected components (SCC)</li>
  <li>Shortest path (if the graph is unweighted)</li>
  <li>And many more</li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, enough hype. Now letâ€™s get to the actual trick. But first, we need a data structure. For convenience we will call it a <em>black box ds</em>, because it can be anything depending on the problem. Initially, our black box ds will contain all the nodes of the graph. For our trick to work, it must support the following operations:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delete(u)</strong>: It deletes everything about node $u$ from the DS.</li>
  <li><strong>Find(u)</strong>: It returns <em>any</em> node $v$ from the DS (which is not yet deleted) such that there is an edge $(u, v)$. If there is no such edge return $-1$. (or any other sentinel value)</li>
</ul>

<p>Easy enough, right? Note that we donâ€™t need to insert anything, we only need the deletion operation. Now, we can write the pseudocode of our DFS like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">dfs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">):</span>
	<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="n">empty</span><span class="p">:</span></code></pre></figure>
