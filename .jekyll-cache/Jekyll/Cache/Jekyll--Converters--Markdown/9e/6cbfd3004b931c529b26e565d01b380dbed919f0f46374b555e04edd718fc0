I"F<p>Many problems require us to deal to dense graphs. I’ll discuss a general technique on how to solve such problems in sub-quadratic time. While this isn’t anything mind-boggling, I find this technique to be extremely useful and surprisingly less-known among competitive programmers.</p>

<p>For whose who don’t know what dense graphs are, they are essentially graphs with $O(n^2)$ edges. The opposite of dense graphs are called sparse graphs, which usually contain $\approx O(n)$ edges. Now, you might be wondering how is it possible to deal with dense graphs in sub-quadratic time while there are already quadratic number of edges. The catch is this technique is only applicable in problems where the edges are ont explicitely given, rather we can decide about the edges based on some given condition. Take this for example:</p>
